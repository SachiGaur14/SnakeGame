## Overview

This is a simple Snake game implemented in Java using Swing components. The game allows players to control a snake, eat apples to score points, and dynamically adjust difficulty as they progress. This README provides information on how to play the game and highlights key features.

## Features

- Classic Snake gameplay with user-friendly controls.
- Randomized apple placement for unpredictability.
- Dynamic difficulty scaling: The game gets faster as you score more points.
- Game over screen displaying the final score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Maven (optional, for building)

### Running the Game

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```

3. Compile and run the game using Java:

## Gameplay

- The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat apples to increase your score.
